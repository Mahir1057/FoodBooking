# 🍽️ FoodBooking System

A sleek and interactive React application where users can browse a food menu, add items to their cart, manage quantities, and track prep time with a countdown timer. Designed for an intuitive user experience, the FoodBooking System mimics the essential features of a real-world hotel food ordering interface.

## 🚀 Features

Display a list of food items with name, description, preparation time, and price.

✅ **Add to Cart Functionality**
Easily add any food item to the cart with a single click.

✅ **Quantity Management**
Users can increment (`+`) or decrement (`-`) the quantity of each item in the cart.

✅ **Live Countdown Timer**
Each item in the cart has a live timer showing the remaining preparation time (in seconds).

✅ **Remove Items**
Cart items can be removed individually using the `Remove` button.

✅ **Real-time Total Cost**
The total cost is automatically updated as you add, remove, or change quantities of items.

✅ **Responsive UI**
The layout adapts to different screen sizes and maintains usability across devices.
